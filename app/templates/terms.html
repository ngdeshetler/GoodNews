          <div style="margin-right:50px; width:75%;">
          <p>An explanation of terms used in table for summary reports</p>
          <h3>Features and Topics</h3>
          <p>Features and topics are the different tags applied to each article via
          the Metric for News system.  
          <br><br>Features that are considered 'yes/no'
          (e.g. 'Has Video') just list that feature, and represent articles tagged 'yes'.
          <br><br>For features types that could have been tagged as one of multiple values (e.g. 'Location')
          the feature listed include first the feature type followed by the 
          value (e.g. "Location: Local (City/Count)").
          <br><br>Some features could have been tagged with multiple values (e.g. Topics: Law <i>and</i>
          Voters). For these features each value is listed as its own unique feature, and
          represent articles tagged with that value.</p>
          <h4>Features verse Topics</h4>
          Topics are treated separate of feature here.  Given the large number 
          of possible topics including them in with all other features would have resulted 
          in hard to read or interpret figures and tables.  Otherwise there are no 
          differences between features and topics.
          <h3>Average</h3>
          <p>
          The average column reports the average for that metric for all articles that 
          have been tagged with that <a href='#Features and Topics'>features/topics</a> 
          </p>
          <h3>Midpoint</h3>
          <p>
          The midpoint column reports the value of that metric where half of the articles
          that have been tagged with that <a href='#Features and Topics'>features/topics</a>
          fall above, and half fall below (also known as the 
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median'>median</a>).<br>
          The midpoint is not influenced by a small number of articles that fall much higher
          or lower on that metric than the majority of articles, and thus gives a better 
          sense of how articles tagged with that feature are performing on that metric.
          </p>
          <h3>Percent Difference from Overall Average</h3>
          <p>
          The overall average is the average of all articles on that metric.
          <br>The percent difference from overall average is what percentage of the overall 
          average that feature's average differs from that overall average. For example, 
          a feature that has a 100% difference from the overall average would be twice the 
          amount of the overall average; the difference between the feature's average and
          the overall average is the same size (100%) as the overall average.
          <br>This measure is useful for describing the difference between the feature's 
          average and the overall average across all metrics, as it controls for the 
          different scales of the various metrics.
          <br>See <a hrf='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_change_and_difference'>wikipedia</a>
          for more information.
          </p>
          <h3>Estimated Difference from All Other Features</h3>
          <p>
          Estimated difference from all other features is the amount on average that 
          articles tagged with that feature differ (in the raw metric score) from all
          articles <i>not</i> tagged with that feature.  Unlike the difference from the
          overall average, articles tagged with that feature are not included in the 
          comparison group.  The estimated difference from all other features represents 
          the expected benefit (or cost if negative) in real metric units (e.g. number of
          visitors) for articles tagged with this feature.
          <br><br>Some features may have a positive difference from the overall mean, but 
          a negative difference from all other features (or visa versa).  
          This is the result of different comparison groups. 
          </p>
          <h3>Confidence in Estimate</h3>
          <p>The confidence in the estimate represents how likely the influence of that
          topic on the metric reflects a true difference in user engagement on that metric
          due to article falling into that feature.  1.0 represented a 100% confidence in
          a true difference while 0.1 would represent only a 10% confidence.  All reported
          confidence in estimate here fall between 1.0-0.9, as this was the cut off used
          to select features. Confidence in estimate represents 1-<a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-value>
          <i>p</i></a>.</p>
          <h3>Performance versus Baseline</h3>
          <p>Performance versus baseline divides <a href='#Features and Topics'>features/topics</a> 
          that consistently affect a metric into groups: Those that fall above the 
          <a href="#Percent Difference Overall Average">overall average</a> (upper performer)
          and those that fall below the overall average (under performers).<br>These labels
          correspond with the coloring of that row: Upper performers: green, 
          Under performers: red.</p>
